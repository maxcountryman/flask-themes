title: Introduction
body: >
    Welcome to the Theme Sandbox. This is a simple Web application intended
    to emulate a weblog. Of course, to save on time and effort, all the posts
    are pregenerated, and the application is just displaying them. But still,
    it gives people a chance to see how themes are implemented.
    
    There are some templates by default, but they aren't particularly shiny.
    You will want to set a theme if you want the blog to look good.

title: Creating Themes
body: >
    With the Theme Sandbox, probably the easiest way to create a theme is just
    to drop it in the "themes/" folder. You can set THEME_PATHS in the
    configuration, but that is still the easiest.
    
    To actually create a theme, you will need to check the manual for details.
    But it essentially boils down to:
    
    An info.json file that contains metadata about the theme,
    
    A templates/ folder that contains the theme's Jinja2 templates.
    
    A static/ folder containing static files to be served.
    
    A license.txt file (optional) containing the theme's complete license.

title: Theme System Inspirations
body: >
    My primary inspiration for the theme system was the blogging system Zine.
    I didn't implement all its features, like options for themes, simply
    because those are tied in to Zine's particular mode of configuration, and
    applications will probably have their own.
    
    One person asked if it was inspired by Deliverance. I looked it up, and
    thought that it looked confusing. But basically, the differences are that
    Flask-Themes is for single applications, Deliverance is for multiple
    applications. Flask-Themes works at the template level, Deliverance works
    at the HTML level. Flask-Themes doesn't deal with HTML/XML, while
    Deliverance does.

    The templates used by this site are:
    
    layout.html, which should have a "body" block and a "head" block (where
    "head" is in the HTML head element), and should expect an exported
    variable named "title" that is the page's title.
    
    index.html, which accepts a "posts" variable that contains three posts.
    
    _helpers.html, which exports a "link_to" macro that takes a caption, an
    endpoint, and keyword arguments.
    
    archive.html, which accepts a "posts" variable that contains *all* of the
    posts.
    
    post.html, which accepts a single "post".
    
    about.html, which accepts "text", the about text as Markup.
    
    themes.html, which accepts a list of themes and should create links to
    "settheme" for each of them.

title: Adding Posts
body: >
    The blog probably seems pretty small to you. And that's the idea - have a
    dataset just big enough to simulate real-world usage. But if you want, you
    can add more posts.
    
    All the posts are stored in the posts.yaml file. You can add them there.
    Slugs must be unique, but that's about the only restriction.
